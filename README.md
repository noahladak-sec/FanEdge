# 🏟️ FanEdge

Sports insights MVP project — built to demonstrate **product management artifacts** and **solution engineering skills**.  
This is part of my career growth roadmap (Sports-Tech Product & AI Solutions tracks).

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a simple sports data app (Python + Streamlit)
- Showcase product management artifacts (PRD, wireframes, case study)
- Demonstrate analytics, storytelling, and demo skills

---

## 📌 Features (MVP Scope)
- Select a fixture from a sample dataset
- Generate a quick **Insight Card** with:
  - Predicted outcome proxy (rule-based or simple model)
  - Top 2–3 factors (form, goals, shots proxy)
  - Confidence band + optional “Why?” explanation
- Simple chart (last 5 matches form trend)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib)
- **Streamlit** (for web app interface)
- **Figma** (wireframes & prototypes)
- **Notion** (PRD, roadmap, case studies)
