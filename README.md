# 🏟️ FanEdge
FanEdge is a simple sports insights MVP designed to help fans make quick, confident decisions before a match.  
This project is a practical way for me to learn and demonstrate Product Management skills by taking an idea from problem → plan → first prototype.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build a simple, easy-to-use sports insights tool.
- Practice defining a problem and scoping an MVP.
- Show my product thinking through clear, organized documentation.
- Demonstrate my ability to turn a concept into a working first version.
- Share my Product Management growth through a clean, structured portfolio project.

-----------

## 📌 What the First Version (MVP) Will Do
The first version of FanEdge is intentionally simple. It will let a user:

- Choose a match from a small sample dataset.
- See a basic prediction based on simple rules (not a full ML model).
- View 2–3 key reasons behind that prediction (like recent form or goals scored).
- See a small chart showing how each team has performed in their last few matches.

The goal is to build a small, clear first version that delivers value quickly.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** — to explore data and create simple logic for the MVP.
- **Streamlit** — to build a basic interactive prototype.
- **Figma** — to sketch early screens and user flows.
- **Notion** — to organize my product notes, plans, and case study.
- **GitHub** — to track progress and share my work.

## 📖 Product Artifacts
This project will grow over time. Here are the documents I’m creating to show my Product Management process:

- A clear explanation of the problem and vision for FanEdge.
- A simple plan for the first version (MVP).
- Early sketches or mockups of the user experience.
- A short case study explaining what I built and what I learned.

All documents are stored in the `/docs` folder.
- [FanEdge Charter v1](docs/FanEdge_Charter_v1.md)

## 🧑‍💻 Setup & Run (coming soon)
As the project grows, I’ll include simple steps here to run the prototype locally.  
For now, the focus is on planning, documentation, and early exploration.

---

## 🚀 Roadmap

**Phase 1 — Define the Problem**
- Understand the fan decision-making process  
- Clarify the value FanEdge should deliver  
- Plan the first version (MVP)

**Phase 2 — Explore the Solution**
- Sketch early screens  
- Outline simple data logic  
- Build a basic interactive prototype

**Phase 3 — Build & Reflect**
- Create a small working MVP  
- Write a short case study  
- Share learnings and next steps

---

## 📚 Case Studies
Once the first version of FanEdge is built, I’ll publish a short case study explaining:

- The problem I focused on
- How I defined the MVP
- What I built
- What I learned
- W I would improve next

link will be added here once it’s ready.
- FanEdge v1 (MVP) — [Notion Case Study Link] (to be added)

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

This project is part of my journey toward Product Management, especially in sports and data-driven technology.  
Thank you to everyone who has supported me along the way and inspired me to grow through learning and experimentation.
